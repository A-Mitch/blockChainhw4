## What is this?

This is a program based off AmazingAndy's Ethereum contract tutorial.

## üíØ Project facts
* It was written in Solidity
* Developed by Alexander Mitchell for Blockchain assignment 4.

## üèé Getting up and Running

‚ùóÔ∏è**IMPORTANT:**
> Check if you have Truffle and testrpc installed globally

### ü§îHow to run
1. Follow Andy's tutorial [one](https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/hello-ethereum-solan-contract-4643118a6119) and [two](https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/eth-testing-472c2f73b4c3), but pay attention to my code because it is updated to the latest version.

2. You create a truffle project by doing the following

```bash
truffle init
```
This will create files for you and you can follow the commands in the tutorial to create the extra files needed.


## üìù Homework outputs

This goes from setting everything up to testing it

1. Setting it up and checking my folder

2. Creating contracts

3. Running them

4. Code that I changed to update to the latest compiler version

![eighth](/pics/test_3.png)

You do not need to run the test command that Andy tells you to do because you can just run:
```bash
truffle test
```
and it will test it for you.

Also run testrpc running in one terminal and have another open to actually test your functions.
Go to your root directory and type in
```bash
testrpc
```

5. Running testrpc and the test failing and passing
